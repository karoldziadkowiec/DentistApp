# DentistApp34

The project presents a window application with an interface for operating a dental office. The application helps to automate processes in the dental office. The application has two forms of use: from the patient's side and from the administrator's (dentist's) side. During this project I created my first application documentation (dokumentacja.pdf). 

Technologies used in the project: C++, .NET, Microsoft SQL Server.

Features of project: registering, logging in, editing the profile, registering visits by choosing a date, canceling a visit, viewing visits, viewing information about the salon, logging out. Administator's side has been enhanced with the following features: viewing customers data, warehouse management (adding and deleting products).
